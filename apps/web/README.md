## Honesty layer — label colors

Every numeric value rendered in a report has a color-coded label so a viewer
can tell at a glance how trusted the value is.

| Label | Dot | Color | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VERIFIED` | 🟢 | emerald | read directly on-chain or from a canonical subgraph |
| `COMPUTED` | 🔵 | cyan | derived mathematically from VERIFIED data |
| `ESTIMATED` | 🟡 | amber | heuristic — comes with a confidence interval |
| `EMULATED` | 🟠 | orange | simulation result — comes with a `warnings[]` array |
| `LABELED` | 🏷️ | violet | manual curation by us |

The `<LabelBadge label="..." />` component renders these consistently. The
diagnose page surfaces VERIFIED + COMPUTED in the header today; ESTIMATED /
EMULATED badges land as the corresponding agent phases ship.

## Routes

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Atlas — wallet input, list of LP positions |
| `/diagnose/:tokenId` | Live SSE diagnostic — phases, tool calls, narrative, IL panel |
